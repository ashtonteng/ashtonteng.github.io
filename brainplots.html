        <p>This is a plot of the activities of 59 electroencephalography (EEG)
        electrodes on the surface of the scalp. The bottom shows the activities,
        color coded by spatial location on the head, and the top shows the distribution
        of activity of the brain at different time points. Data was collected
        from an experiment where the participant listened to stimulus
        presented to the left auditory field.</p>

        <p>This is a visualization of the voxels (3D pixels) in the thalamus. The colors
          represent how correlated each voxel is with a seed area outside of the thalamus
          that was stimulated with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)</p>

      <p>This is a 2D version of the image above, choosing only to visualize one
        plane going through a cross-section of the thalamus.</p>

      <p>This is the plot of the time series of electrocorticography (ECoG) 
        electrodes sitting directly on the surface of the brain</p>

      <img src="images/brain/channels.png" style="width:60%;">
      <p>This is a simple plot showing 59 channels of EEG data while
        the participant is exposed to stimulus on the left auditory field.</p>
