      <p>Hello! I’m Ashton. I am currently pursuing a M.S. in Biomedical Informatics at Stanford University. I previously graduated from UC Berkeley with Bachelor’s degrees in Computer Science and Cognitive Neuroscience.</p>
      <p>I am passionate about empowering biomedical research and applications with software and data science tools. I am extremely excited about the exponentially growing amount of biological, health, and medical data available, and am glad to be a part of the revolution to make such data actionable. This will contribute to our understanding of the fundamentals of biology and improve our health and wellness as a society.</p>
      <p>In my work, I love building products that revolutionize existing processes and make a real impact in the world - striving for optimization, efficiency, and a great user experience.
