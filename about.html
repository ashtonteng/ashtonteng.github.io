      <p>Hello! Iâ€™m Ashton, a fourth year Cognitive Neuroscience and Computer Science double major. I love doing scientific research, and am currently a research assistant at the <a href="http://despolab.berkeley.edu">D'Esposito Cognitive Development Lab</a> at UC Berkeley. I help investigate the role of the thalamus in 
        modulating functional connectivity throughout the brain. I also work at the 
        <a href="http://gallantlab.org"> Gallant Lab</a> where I work on projects that use NLP models to decode and map out how language is represented in the brain.</p>
      <p>I love playing badminton, skiing, reading Wikipedia, and playing Runescape. Feel free to <a href="/contact.html">contact me</a> about anything!</p>
