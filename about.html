      <p>Hello! I’m Ashton. I'm currently working as a Bioinformatics and Data Engineer at <a href="https://grail.com/">GRAIL</a>, where I build bioinformatics pipelines to help detect cancer early, when it can be cured. I previously graduated from Stanford with a M.S. in Biomedical Informatics, and UC Berkeley with Bachelor’s degrees in Computer Science and Cognitive Neuroscience.</p>
      <p>I am passionate about empowering biomedical research and applications with software and data science tools. I am extremely excited about the exponentially growing amount of biological, health, and medical data available, and am glad to be a part of the revolution to make such data actionable. This will contribute to our understanding of the fundamentals of biology and improve our health and wellness as a society.</p>
      <p>In my work, I love building products that revolutionize existing processes and make a real impact in the world - striving for optimization, efficiency, and a great user experience. I have a strong background in data science, software engineering, scientific research and leadership, with a creative and analytical mindset.
