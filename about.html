      <p>Hello! Iâ€™m Ashton, a third year Cognitive Neuroscience and Computer Science double major. I love doing scientific research, and am currently a research assistant at the <a href="http://despolab.berkeley.edu">D'Esposito Cognitive Development Lab</a> at UC Berkeley. I help investigate the role of the thalamus in 
        modulating functional connectivity throughout the brain. I also work at the 
        <a href="http://gallantlab.org"> Gallant Lab</a> where I work on projects that aim
        to use NLP models and machine learning techniques to map out how language
        is represented in the brain. Previously, I researched cognitive flexibility and social attribution at the <a href="http://alisongopnik.com/Alison_Gopnik_Research.htm">Gopnik Cognitive Development Lab</a> at UC Berkeley. I am also interested in combining the brain and the computer - whether it be brain machine interfaces, cognitive enhancements, or artificial intelligence.</p>
      <p>I love playing badminton, skiing, reading Wikipedia, data mining, making websites, and playing games such as Hearthstone and Agar.io. Feel free to <a href="/contact.html">contact me</a> about anything!</p>
