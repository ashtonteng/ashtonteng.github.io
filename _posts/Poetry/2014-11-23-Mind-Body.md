You ask me if for some people,  
I hurt when they hurt,  
and laugh while they laugh,  
and make every piece of effort I can,  
to give them warmth and happiness.  
I reply no, I can’t decide,  
while my soul hollers inside -  
And my face sits motionless.  

One cannot help to love!  
Tis’ an emotion that transcends  
the simplicity of bodily desires.  
But the mind can be trapped within the body -  
bereft of the ability to express its feelings,  
and ends up neglected, of the love  
that it so desperately needs to survive.  

There is a no such thing as a beautiful mind in an ugly body -  
Only an ugly body hauling around a beautiful mind.
