I am wrestling my umbrella  
blown furiously by the roaring rain  
covering the vast whole scene  
like distant noise on a television screen.  
And my mind wanders  
to the angered, protesting peoples,  
roaring like the rain,  
again and again, driven to the rim  
by the systematic oppression  
of institutions at their whim.  

The rain makes waves on the ground.  
Pulsing, to the pulsing wind,  
to the beats of ardent chants,  
funneled into my brain ---  
an overwhelming frenzied calm  
in this stormy freedom rain.
