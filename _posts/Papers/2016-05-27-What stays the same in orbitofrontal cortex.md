title:  "What stays the same in orbitofrontal cortex"
date:   2016-05-27

description: This study showed that neurons in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) do not seem to encode the sensory features of reward, but rather the degree of preferability of a reward.

`Experimental Setup`:

`Results`:

*Control Group (AB-AB):*

- The monkey prefers A over B.
- Block 1: Neuron 1 maps to A, Neuron 2 maps to B
- Block 2: Neuron 1 maps to A, Neuron 2 maps to B

*Experimental Group (AB-CD):*

- The monkey prefers A over B, C over D.
- Block 1: Neuron 1 maps to A, Neuron 2 maps to B
- Block 2: Neuron 1 maps to C, Neuron 2 maps to D
- Remapping consistent with preference order!
- The neural responses in the AB-CD design was indistinguishable from the control, AB-AB design.

*2nd Experimental Group (AB-CA):*

- The monkey prefers A over B, C over A.
- Block 1: Neuron 1 maps to A, Neuron 2 maps to B
- Block 2: Neuron 1 maps to C (!), Neuron 2 maps to A

- Remapping consistent with preference order, even when previously preferred option was still available!
- Strong evidence indicating that OFC neurons do not encode sensory features of rewards, but the evaluation of the reward in the context of the current decision.
- OFC neurons seem to be tuned to decision parameters, rather than the specific properties of the goods under consideration.

*In relation to ‘cognitive map theory’:*

- Cognitive map theory suggests that the OFC constructs internal models of the environment, or ‘task structure’, in order to determine optimal decisions.
- Previously, it was thought that OFC neurons can encode arbitrary variables related to the task.
- However, this study shows that there are constraints to which variables OFC neurons can represent! In this experiment, researchers showed that some neurons only encode more preferred rewards, and vice versa.
